# Stage one package directory for publishing: `npm stage publish` through OIDC trusted publishing.
#
# A staged version is not installable until a maintainer approves it with 2FA (`pnpm stage
# approve`, or the Staged Packages tab on npmjs.com). CI can only stage, because the trusted
# publisher on every @nubjs package is stage-only: a stolen push credential that cuts a tag can
# fill the staged queue and nothing else — which is what the 2026-09-21 v0.9.4 incident needed.
#
# Idempotent on a re-run. A version already live is skipped by the `npm view` check; a version
# already sitting in the staged queue makes `npm stage publish` refuse (npm reserves the number
# while it is staged), and that refusal is a success here: release.yml's npm-served job still
# gates on the registry serving the version after the approval. The refusal's exact wording is
# matched loosely because the first stage-only release is where it gets observed; anything else
# stays fatal.
