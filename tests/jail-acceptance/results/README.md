# install-script sweep results

Two generations of results live here and they are not the same measurement. Read this before
comparing them, because the schemas differ and only one of them is reproducible.

## `install-script-sweep-macos.tsv` — the hand-adjudicated generation. Keep it.

Eight columns, the last being `npm-differential`: a prose judgement on each failing row, of the form
`npm: IDENTICAL failure - ... Not nub-caused`. **No script in this repository produces that column.**
It was written by hand, so nothing can regenerate it and nothing can check it — which is exactly why
it is worth keeping: it is the known-answer control the adjudicated generation had to reproduce
before its verdicts were worth anything.

Its `JAIL-SUSPECT` verdict is a proxy, not a control. It fires when a failing run's log merely looks
permission- or network-shaped, which is also what ecosystem rot looks like from the outside.

## `install-script-sweep-<os>-adjudicated.tsv` — produced by the sweep itself

Eleven columns, written by `../install-script-sweep.sh`. A failing row is classified by running the
same package two more ways rather than by reading its log:

| verdict | what happened | what it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OK` | jailed arm passed | nothing to adjudicate |
| `JAIL-CAUSED` | failed jailed, **passed** with `install.buildJail: false` | the jail did it. The only verdict that indicts the jail, and the only one that fails the gate. |
| `NUB-CAUSED` | failed both nub arms, **npm passed** | a package-manager defect, not the jail |
| `UPSTREAM` | all three failed | the package is broken for everyone |
| `NO-SCRIPT-RAN` | no confined spawn | nothing was measured; not a pass |

Columns: `package`, `verdict`, `rc=`, `scripts-ran=` (confined spawns, from `NUB_JAIL_DUMP_POLICY`),
`jail-lines=`, `net-err=`, `deny=`, `nojail-rc=`, `npm-rc=`, first error, control error. The three
detector columns survive as diagnostics and no longer decide the verdict.

`scripts-ran=0` on a passing row would mean the jail never ran, so a sweep is only as good as that
column: check it before reading any tally.

## Reproducing

```sh
NUB=/path/to/nub ./tests/jail-acceptance/install-script-sweep.sh \
  --population tests/jail-acceptance/results/install-script-population.tsv
```

Cold every time, `allowBuilds` on so the script actually runs, and the grant left exactly as shipped.
Passing `--population` pins the package set; omitting it rediscovers one from the registry.
