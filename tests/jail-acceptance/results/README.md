# install-script sweep results

Two generations of results live here and they are not the same measurement. Read this before
comparing them, because the schemas differ and only one of them is reproducible.

## `install-script-sweep-macos.tsv` — the hand-adjudicated generation. Keep it.

Eight columns, the last being `npm-differential`: a prose judgement on each failing row, of the form
`npm: IDENTICAL failure - ... Not nub-caused`. **No script in this repository produces that column.**
It was written by hand, so nothing can regenerate it and nothing can check it — which is exactly why
it is worth keeping: it is the known-answer control the adjudicated generation had to reproduce
before its verdicts were worth anything.

Its `JAIL-SUSPECT` verdict is a proxy, not a control. It fires when a failing run's log merely looks
permission- or network-shaped, which is also what ecosystem rot looks like from the outside.

## `install-script-sweep-<os>-adjudicated.tsv` — produced by the sweep itself

Eleven columns, written by `../install-script-sweep.sh`. A failing row is classified by running the
same package two more ways rather than by reading its log:

| verdict | what happened | what it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OK` | jailed arm passed | nothing to adjudicate |
| `JAIL-CAUSED` | failed jailed, **passed** with `install.buildJail: false` | the jail did it. The only verdict that indicts the jail, and the only one that fails the gate. |
| `NUB-CAUSED` | failed both nub arms, **npm passed** | a package-manager defect, not the jail |
| `UPSTREAM` | all three failed | the package is broken for everyone |
| `NO-SCRIPT-RAN` | no confined spawn | nothing was measured; not a pass |

Columns: `package`, `verdict`, `rc=`, `confined-spawns=`, `jail-lines=`, `net-err=`, `deny=`,
`nojail-rc=`, `npm-rc=`, first error, control error. The three detector columns survive as
diagnostics and no longer decide the verdict.

`confined-spawns=0` on a passing row would mean the jail never ran, so a sweep is only as good as
that column: check it before reading any tally.

⛔ **The three landed TSVs predate that column and spell it `scripts-ran=`, counting POLICY-DUMP LINES
rather than spawns.** `NUB_JAIL_DUMP_POLICY` emits a multi-line dump per confined spawn whose length
tracks the grant’s rule count, so one spawn measured 36 lines for `core-js@3.46.0` and 54 for
`bufferutil@4.0.9`; exactly one line per spawn carries `pkg=`, which is what the column counts now.
No verdict depended on the difference — both forms answer “did the jail engage at all” identically —
but the old number read as a script tally and was not one. Divide an old value by nothing: it is not
a fixed multiple.

## Reproducing

```sh
NUB=/path/to/nub ./tests/jail-acceptance/install-script-sweep.sh \
  --population tests/jail-acceptance/results/install-script-population.tsv
```

Cold every time, `allowBuilds` on so the script actually runs, and the grant left exactly as shipped.
Passing `--population` pins the package set; omitting it rediscovers one from the registry.

## Coverage

macOS covers all 87 packages of the population. Linux covers 85: `duckdb` and `rocksdb` are the
heavy tail, and each of the three arms allows twenty minutes, so a package that fails slowly on all
three cannot finish inside one builder's lifetime. They are recorded here as absent rather than folded
into the tally - an unmeasured package is not a passing one, and treating it as one is how a sweep
flatters itself. Together they are 0.050% of the population's weekly-download weight.

Windows is unmeasured: no runner in this branch accepts a free-form script on that platform.
